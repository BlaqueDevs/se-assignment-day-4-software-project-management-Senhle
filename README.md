# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management
Timely project delivery is essential for any business operation, as it affects customer satisfaction, profitability, and reputation.
It saves money by avoiding extra costs.
How can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Planning Well – Set clear goals and deadlines.
 planning is crucial for meeting project deadlines because it sets a clear roadmap for success. By breaking the project into smaller tasks, defining milestones, and assigning responsibilities, you ensure that everyone knows what needs to be done and when. It also helps identify potential risks early, allowing you to adjust timelines or resources before issues become critical. A detailed plan keeps the project organized, on track, and minimizes surprises, making it easier to deliver on time.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Managing costs well is important because it helps a software project stay on track, avoid financial problems, and deliver good results.
What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Set a Realistic Budget – Plan for all costs, including development, testing, and unexpected expenses.
Define Project Scope Clearly – Avoid adding extra features that weren’t planned (scope creep).
Track Spending Regularly – Use tools like Trello or Jira to monitor expenses.
Plan for Risks – Set aside extra money (10-20% of the budget) for unexpected problems.
Use Resources Wisely – Assign the right people to the right tasks to avoid wasting money.
Get Accurate Cost Estimates – Ask experienced developers and use detailed calculations.
Communicate with Everyone – Keep clients and team members updated on costs and changes.
Use Budgeting Tools – Software like QuickBooks or Smartsheet helps track expenses.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile and Waterfall are project management methodologies with a key difference being that Agile is  a flexible and iterative approach that enables teams to quickly adapt to changing project requirements and deliver high-quality results within shorter timeframes. It’s very often used in software development.The waterfall project management method is a linear, step-by-step approach that's ideal for projects with a clear scope and predictable timeline. 
What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Advantages of waterfall	
Supports all planning to be completed up front with a clear roadmap for every stage of the project.
Utilizes a clear, structured approach.
Easy to track progress, identify risks, and manage project budgets.
Project manager holds significant authority over the project, plan, and value delivery.

Disadvantages of waterfall	
Not flexible—hard to change requirements
Clients don’t see the product until the end
Late testing increases the risk of major errors

Agile Methodology
 Advantages:
Flexible and adaptable to changes
Delivers usable software quickly
Continuous feedback improves quality
Issues are identified early

Disadvantages:
Requires constant communication and collaboration
Hard to predict exact costs and timelines
Not ideal for small projects with clear requirements
